## A project exploring lens protocol API in creating profiles, managing it and employing profile manager utilities.

This project renders a dyanamic page. 

It takes an Ethereum address, checks if there are profiles attached to  it. Retrieves the profile data via the "id". If there isn't, creates a profile, retrieves its information as above.

The alternate page takes "Private key" and an "IPFS" link and creates a post. 

Error was handled.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
